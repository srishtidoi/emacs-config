#+TITLE:  Doom Emacs Configuration --- [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][HTML Version]]

Here you may find the config. There are only two files which matter
 - [[file:config.org][config.org]], my configuration file
 - [[file:init.el][init.el]], the doom-modules file

What you *really* want is the =M-x org-html-export-to-html= version of ~config.org~
(linked in the title).
